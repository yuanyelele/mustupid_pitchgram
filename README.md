# Pitchgram for Stupid Musician

Pitchgram is like a spectrogram, but to display pitches (cents actually) in realtime. It uses an autocorrelation pitch detection algorithm called YIN.

without parabolic interpolation, precision(d cents/d point) = 1200/ln2*frequency/samplerate

Currently in alpha stage.
